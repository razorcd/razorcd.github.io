---

Personal project to demonstrate an end to end automated ML infrastructure

The challenge requested to build an fully automated end-to-end Machine Learning infrastructure, including reading data from a feature store, automated model creation with hyperoptimization tuning and automatically finding the most efficient model, storing models in a model registry, building a CI/CD pipeline for deploying the registered model into a production environment, serving the model using HTTP API or Streaming interfaces, implementing monitoring, writing tests and linters, creating regular automated reporting.
